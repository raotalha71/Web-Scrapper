PROXY SCRAPER IMPROVEMENTS - SUMMARY OF FIXES
==============================================

Issues Found in Original proxy_scraper.py:
1. ❌ Many domains redirecting to generic parking pages (www.com)
2. ❌ Cloudflare/security blocks not properly detected
3. ❌ Domain verification too aggressive, accepting invalid redirects
4. ❌ No filtering of expired/parked domains
5. ❌ No proper handling of 404/blocked sites

Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ Added invalid domain filtering (www.com, parked.com, sedo.com, etc.)
2. ✅ Enhanced security block detection (Cloudflare, bot protection, etc.)
3. ✅ Improved domain verification logic - only accepts valid alternatives
4. ✅ Added content validation before taking screenshots
5. ✅ Better error handling and logging
6. ✅ Extended timeouts and browser options for difficult sites

Results Expected:
- Fewer false positives from parking pages
- Better detection of actually blocked sites
- More accurate success/failure reporting
- Cleaner data with proper error messages

Next Steps:
1. Run the updated proxy scraper
2. Check the logs for better error reporting
3. Review the CSV output for improved data quality
